# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this prework study guide was to learn how to navigate github and git. There is a way to link the directory on a personal laptop with github. This will make saving files easier since we are saving it to a cloud-based platform so that too much code doesnt populate your laptop.

I built this project to get a hang of the structure behind what is needed to create a webpage.
